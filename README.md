### Project Overview

**Project Title:** Secure and Interactive Webpage Overlay

**Objective:**
This project aims to create a secure and visually appealing overlay on a webpage that activates after detecting unusual user inactivity or breaches of agreement between the developer and client. The overlay includes a countdown timer, beautiful animations, gradient backgrounds, and interactive particles using Particle.js. The overlay remains on the screen until the page is reloaded, ensuring a persistent visual warning or message. Additionally, the project protects user and client rights during the creation process by locking the page and providing informative overlays in specific scenarios.

**Key Features:**
1. **Breach of Agreement Overlay:** 
   - Activates 10 seconds after page load.
   - Displays a countdown timer in the top-right corner of the screen.
   - Shows a message indicating the overlay is due to a breach of agreement.
   - Includes animated text and emojis.
   - Overlay persists until the page is reloaded.

2. **Inactivity Overlay:**
   - Activates after 10 seconds of inactivity.
   - Displays a countdown timer in the top-right corner of the screen.
   - Shows a message prompting user interaction to continue.
   - Overlay can be removed by user interaction (mouse movement or keypress).

3. **Persistent Page Lock:**
   - Locks the entire page after 2 minutes, ensuring that the overlay remains active until the page is reloaded.
   
4. **Animations and Visual Effects:**
   - Gradient background animation for a dynamic and visually appealing look.
   - Bouncing text and emoji animations for added interactivity.
   - Particle.js integration for beautiful particle effects.
   - Floating site name text with animations.

5. **Professional and Responsive Design:**
   - Centered and aligned text for a clean and professional appearance.
   - Responsive design to ensure functionality across different devices and screen sizes.
   - Animated countdown timer to provide visual feedback to the user.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML for structuring the webpage content.
- CSS for styling, animations, and responsive design.
- JavaScript for handling overlay logic, countdown timers, and interactions.
- Particle.js for interactive particle effects.

**Implementation Details:**
- **HTML Structure:** Properly structured elements for the content, overlays, and timers.
- **CSS Styling:** Enhanced animations, gradient backgrounds, and text animations.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Countdown timers, inactivity detection, overlay activation, and Particle.js integration.

This project provides a secure and visually captivating experience for users, ensuring both user and client rights are protected during the development and deployment phases.
